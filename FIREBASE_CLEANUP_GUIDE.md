# Firebase Cleanup Guide

## Current Status
Your project has been successfully migrated from Firebase to Supabase. However, there are still some leftover Firebase references that should be cleaned up to avoid confusion and potential conflicts.

## Files to Remove
Based on the project analysis, the following Firebase-related files can be safely removed:

### 1. Firebase Configuration Files (if they exist)
- `src/lib/firebase.ts`
- `src/lib/firebaseAuth.ts` 
- `src/lib/firebaseConfig.ts`
- `src/lib/firebaseAuthHelpers.ts`

### 2. Firebase Service Files (if they exist)
- Any files in `src/services/` that contain Firebase logic

## Current Backend: Supabase
Your project now uses these Supabase files:

### Primary Supabase Files
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Main Supabase client and database service
- `src/lib/supabaseAuth.ts` - Authentication service
- `src/contexts/NewAuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context using Supabase

### Migration Documentation
- `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - Documents the completed migration
- `SUPABASE_RLS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - RLS troubleshooting guide

## RLS Issues Fixed
The main issue you were experiencing was due to missing or incorrect Row Level Security (RLS) policies. The migration I've created will:

1. **Drop conflicting policies** that might be causing permission issues
2. **Create comprehensive policies** for organizer_events, ticket_types, attendees, and analytics
3. **Add proper error handling** in your service files
4. **Ensure admin override** capabilities are maintained

## What the RLS Policies Do

### For organizer_events table:
- Organizers can create events (INSERT) where they are the organizer
- Organizers can view their own events (SELECT)
- Organizers can update their own events (UPDATE)
- Organizers can delete their own events (DELETE)
- Admins can do all operations on any event

### For related tables (tickets, attendees, analytics):
- Access is granted based on ownership of the parent event
- If you own the event, you can manage its tickets, attendees, and view analytics

## Testing the Fix

After running the migration, test the following:

1. **Login as an organizer**
2. **Try creating a new event** - should work without permission errors
3. **View your events** - should load without issues
4. **Create ticket types** - should work for your events
5. **View analytics** - should display data for your events

## Error Handling Improvements

The updated service files now include:

- **Better error logging** for debugging
- **Specific error messages** for RLS issues
- **Graceful degradation** when permissions are insufficient
- **User-friendly error messages** instead of technical database errors

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your environment:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the RLS migration** to fix the permission issues
2. **Test the organizer dashboard** to ensure it works properly
3. **Remove any leftover Firebase files** if they exist
4. **Update any remaining Firebase imports** in your code

## Support

If you continue to experience issues after running the migration:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify your Supabase environment variables are correct
3. Ensure your user profile has the 'organizer' role in the database
4. Check the Supabase dashboard for any RLS policy conflicts

The migration should resolve the "permission denied" errors and prevent the infinite loading/logout loop you were experiencing.
