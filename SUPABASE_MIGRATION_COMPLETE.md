# Firebase to Supabase Migration - Complete

## Migration Summary

This migration successfully removes Firebase completely and implements Supabase as the unified solution for both authentication and database operations.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Removed Firebase Dependencies**
- ❌ Removed `firebase` package from dependencies
- ❌ Deleted `src/lib/firebaseConfig.ts`
- ❌ Deleted `src/lib/firebaseAuth.ts`
- ❌ Deleted `src/lib/firebaseAuthHelpers.ts`
- ❌ Removed Firebase-specific service files
- ❌ Cleaned up Firebase imports throughout the codebase

### 2. **Updated Supabase Configuration**
- ✅ Created unified `src/lib/supabase.ts` with both auth and database services
- ✅ Configured Supabase client using Vercel environment variables
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive authentication service
- ✅ Added database service with CRUD operations
- ✅ Added TypeScript types for better type safety

### 3. **Updated Authentication System**
- ✅ Migrated `AuthContext` to use Supabase Auth
- ✅ Updated all authentication flows (login, register, logout, password reset)
- ✅ Maintained existing user roles and permissions
- ✅ Updated all navigation components to use Supabase user data
- ✅ Fixed profile data access throughout the application

### 4. **Updated Database Operations**
- ✅ Migrated all database operations to use Supabase
- ✅ Updated admin dashboard to use Supabase queries
- ✅ Fixed event management to use Supabase CRUD operations
- ✅ Maintained existing RLS policies and security

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Vercel environment:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## Key Benefits of Migration

### 1. **Simplified Architecture**
- Single backend service (Supabase) instead of Firebase + Supabase
- Unified authentication and database operations
- Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead

### 2. **Better Integration**
- Native Supabase Auth with RLS policies
- No more token passing between services
- Consistent user identification across all operations

### 3. **Enhanced Security**
- Supabase RLS policies work natively with Supabase Auth
- No authentication mismatch issues
- Proper user context in all database operations

### 4. **Improved Developer Experience**
- Single SDK to learn and maintain
- Better TypeScript support
- Unified error handling

## Authentication Flow (Updated)

1. **Signup**: User registers with Supabase Auth (email, password, name, role)
2. **Profile Creation**: User profile automatically created via database trigger
3. **Email Verification**: User receives Supabase verification email
4. **Login**: User can login after email verification
5. **Role-Based Routing**: Users redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role
6. **Session Management**: Supabase handles session persistence

## API Changes

### Before (Firebase Auth + Supabase DB)
```typescript
// Firebase Auth
const userCredential = await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
// Then set Supabase context
await setSupabaseAuth(userCredential.user);
```

### After (Supabase Only)
```typescript
// Supabase Auth
const result = await authService.signIn(email, password);
// User context automatically available for database operations
```

## Database Operations

### Before
```typescript
// Complex Firebase UID to Supabase mapping
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', firebaseUser.uid);
```

### After
```typescript
// Direct Supabase operations
const result = await authService.getUserProfile();
```

## Testing the Migration

### 1. **Authentication Flow**
1. Register a new user with any role
2. Check email verification process
3. Login with verified account
4. Test password reset flow
5. Test logout functionality

### 2. **Role-Based Access**
1. Test attendee dashboard access
2. Test organizer event creation
3. Test sponsor booth management
4. Test admin panel access

### 3. **Database Operations**
1. Create events as organizer
2. Register for events as attendee
3. Manage booth as sponsor
4. View analytics and manage users as admin

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you need to rollback to Firebase:

1. Restore Firebase configuration files from git history
2. Reinstall Firebase package: `npm install firebase`
3. Revert AuthContext changes
4. Restore Firebase-specific service files
5. Update environment variables

## Next Steps

1. **Test All Functionality**: Thoroughly test all authentication and database operations
2. **Update Documentation**: Update any remaining Firebase references in documentation
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check that Supabase performance meets requirements
4. **User Communication**: Inform users about any changes to authentication flow

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Supabase dashboard for authentication and database logs
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set in Vercel
3. Test RLS policies in Supabase SQL editor
4. Check browser console for any authentication errors

The migration is now complete and your application uses Supabase as the unified solution for both authentication and database operations.
