  # Fix infinite recursion in profiles RLS policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Remove problematic RLS policies that cause infinite recursion
    - Add simplified policies that work with Firebase authentication
    - Ensure proper access control without circular dependencies

  2. Policy Updates
    - Remove policies that reference auth.uid() causing recursion
    - Add basic read access for public profiles
    - Add update access for authenticated users to their own profiles
